# Contributing

Welcome to SchemaJS! Before you make a contribution, be it a bug report, documentation improvement,
pull request (PR), etc., please read and follow these guidelines.

## Start with filing an issue

More often than not, **start by filing an issue on GitHub**. If you have a bug report or feature
request, open a GitHub issue. Non-trivial PRs will also require a GitHub issue. The issue provides
us with a space to discuss proposed changes with you and the community.

Having a discussion via GitHub issue upfront is the best way to ensure your contribution lands in
SchemaJS. We don't want you to spend your time making a PR, only to find that we won't accept it on
a design basis. For example, we may find that your proposed feature works better as a third-party
module built on top of or for use with SchemaJS and encourage you to pursue that direction instead.

**You do not need to file an issue for small fixes.** What counts as a "small" or trivial fix is a
judgment call, so here's a few examples to clarify:
- fixing a typo
- refactoring a bit of code
- most documentation or comment edits

Still, _sometimes_ we may review your PR and ask you to file an issue if we expect there are larger
design decisions to be made.

## Making a PR

After you've filed an issue, you can make your PR referencing that issue number. Once you open your
PR, it will be labelled _Needs Review_. A maintainer will review your PR as soon as they can. The
reviewer may ask for changes - they will mark the PR as _Changes Requested_ and will give you
details about the requested changes. Feel free to ask lots of questions! The maintainers are there
to help you.

### Caveats
